## Overview
SwissInsure is a comprehensive, secure, and scalable MVP designed specifically for the Swiss insurance market. The platform meets stringent Swiss regulatory requirements while providing an exceptional user experience through multilingual interfaces for both policyholders and administrators.

## Features

### Compliance & Security
- Full compliance with Swiss data protection laws (FADP/LPD), FINMA guidelines, and GDPR
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect (via Keycloak) for secure authentication
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Centralized logging using ELK stack with detailed audit trails
- Deployed on Google Cloud Platform (Zurich region) ensuring data residency

### Multi-Platform Experience
- React Native mobile app (TypeScript) for policyholders
- SSR-enabled Next.js web portal (TypeScript) with multilingual support (French, German, Italian)
- Java Spring Boot dashboard for internal analytics
- Next.js dashboard for real-time monitoring

### Data Management
- PostgreSQL database with transactional support and rollback capabilities
- Redis caching for performance optimization
- Robust data schema for users, policies, claims, logs, and auditing

### Infrastructure
- Containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipeline with strict testing and review requirements
- Disciplined Git Flow methodology
- Proactive alerting with Prometheus and Alertmanager

## Target Audiences

### Policyholders (B2C)
- Mobile app (React Native/TypeScript)
- Web portal (Next.js/TypeScript)
- Multilingual experience (French, German, Italian)
- SSR for optimal performance and improved SEO

### Internal Administrators
- Analytics dashboard (Java Spring Boot)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard (Next.js)
- Secure REST APIs for operations management

## Architecture

### 1. Front-End (B2C)

#### Web Portal with GraphQL (Next.js in TypeScript)
- Provides GraphQL API endpoints directly from the Next.js application
- Serves both the SSR web portal and the React Native mobile client
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Full internationalization (i18n) for French, German, and Italian

#### Mobile Application (React Native in TypeScript)
- Consumes the GraphQL API provided by the Next.js Web Portal
- Native, multilingual experience for policyholders

### 2. Back-End (Internal Dashboard)

#### Internal Dashboard (Java Spring Boot)
- Secure REST APIs for analytics, reporting, and operations
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication (via Keycloak)
- Strict security measures (TLS/SSL, input validation)
- Exposes REST endpoints exclusively for the internal Next.js Monitoring Dashboard
- Receives and processes alert data from Alertmanager for real-time dashboard display

### 3. API-Accessible Dashboard (Monitoring)

#### Monitoring Dashboard (Next.js in TypeScript)
- Real-time usage, performance metrics, and alerts
- Consumes REST APIs exclusively from the Spring Boot backend
- Displays alert data processed by Spring Boot from Alertmanager
- Client-side rendering with effective caching
- Internal-only access for administrators and operations team

### 4. Data Integration Layer

#### API Gateway
- Handles routing between GraphQL and REST endpoints
- Provides consistent API experience across services
- Implements rate limiting and request validation

### 5. Shared Database

#### Database Schema
- USERS: Policyholder information
- POLICIES: Insurance policy details
- CLAIMS: Claims records and tracking
- USAGE_LOGS: User interaction tracking
- AUDIT: Compliance and security logs

#### Data Management Strategy
- PostgreSQL: Primary database for all transactional data
- Redis: Caching layer for frequently accessed data and session management
- Data synchronization handled through transaction logs and cache invalidation
- ORM implementation details:
  - Prisma (Next.js): For web and monitoring dashboard access
  - Hibernate (Spring Boot): For internal dashboard and business logic

### 6. Infrastructure & Deployment
- Docker containerization: Each service runs in its own container
- Kubernetes orchestration: Containers are deployed as pods in Kubernetes (a Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes)
- Load balancing for traffic distribution across all pods
- GCP (Zurich region) deployment ensuring Swiss data residency compliance

### 7. Logging & Alerting
- ELK stack for centralized logging
- Prometheus with Alertmanager for proactive notifications
- Alertmanager writes alert data to shared PostgreSQL database
- Spring Boot Dashboard reads alert data from the same PostgreSQL database
- Bi-directional data flow enables real-time monitoring and historical analysis

### 8. Testing Strategy & TDD
- Test-Driven Development approach
- Comprehensive test coverage: unit, integration, end-to-end, API
- Performance and security testing integrated into CI/CD

## Development Workflow

### Git Flow Branching Strategy
- `master`: Stable, production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `release/*`: Release preparation and final testing
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent production fixes

### Code Review & Merging
- Mandatory code reviews before merging
- CI/CD pipeline validation for all commits
- Only approved, tested code reaches the main branch
