- CLAIMS: Claims records and tracking
- USAGE_LOGS: User interaction tracking
- AUDIT: Compliance and security logs

#### Optimizations & Data Persistence
- PostgreSQL with full transactional support
- Indexing and partitioning for query optimization
- Redis caching for accelerated data access
- ORM tools (Prisma for Next.js, Hibernate for Spring Boot)

### 5. Infrastructure & Deployment
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Load balancing for traffic distribution
- GCP (Zurich region) deployment

### 6. Logging & Alerting
- ELK stack for centralized logging
- Prometheus with Alertmanager for proactive notifications

### 7. Testing Strategy & TDD
- Test-Driven Development approach
- Comprehensive test coverage: unit, integration, end-to-end, API
- Performance and security testing integrated into CI/CD

## Development Workflow â€“ Git Flow

### Branching Strategy
- `master`: Stable, production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `release/*`: Release preparation and final testing
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent production fixes

### Code Review & Merging
- Mandatory code reviews before merging
- CI/CD pipeline validation for all commits
- Only approved, tested code reaches the main branch
